                     }
               
9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
         Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging in VS Code
                  1. Install Required Extensions (if needed)
                  Ensure you have the necessary language-specific debugging extension installed. For example, for JavaScript/Node.js, you might need the "Debugger for Chrome" or "Node.js Debug" extension.
                  2. Open Your Project
                  Open your project folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder).
                  3. Create or Open a File to Debug
                  Open the file containing the code you want to debug.
                  4. Set Breakpoints
                  Click in the gutter next to the line numbers where you want to set a breakpoint. This marks the line where the debugger will pause execution.
                  Alternatively, use the shortcut F9 to toggle a breakpoint at the current line.
                  5. Configure Debugging Launch Configuration
                  Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar (or use Ctrl + Shift + D).
                  Click on the gear icon (⚙️) next to the green play button (Start Debugging) and select the environment you want to debug (e.g., Node.js, Chrome, Python).
                  VS Code will generate a default launch.json configuration file or prompt you to select a configuration template.
                  6. Start Debugging
                  Click on the green play button (Start Debugging) in the Debug view, or press F5.
                  VS Code will start debugging based on the selected configuration.
                  7. Debugging Controls
                  Step Over: Execute the current line and move to the next line.
                  Shortcut: F10 or Ctrl + Shift + I (for Step Into on macOS).
                  Step Into: Step into a function call.
                  Shortcut: F11 or Ctrl + Shift + I.
                  Step Out: Step out of the current function.
                  Shortcut: Shift + F11 or Ctrl + Shift + O.
                  Continue: Resume execution until the next breakpoint.
                  Shortcut: F5.
                  Restart: Restart debugging session.
                  Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + F5.
                  Stop: Stop debugging session.
                  Shortcut: Shift + F5.
                  Key Debugging Features in VS Code
                  Variable Watch: Monitor and inspect the values of variables in the Debug Console or Variables view.
                  Call Stack: View the current call stack of the program, showing the path through nested function calls.
                  Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when specific conditions are met.
                  Exception Handling: Configure how VS Code handles exceptions and uncaught errors during debugging.
                  Debug Console: Interact with your application by executing commands or evaluating expressions in a dedicated console.
                  Example Scenario
                  Suppose you have a JavaScript file app.js with the following code:function add(a, b) {
                     return a + b;
                  }

                  let result = add(3, 5);
                  console.log(result);

                  Set a breakpoint on line 4 (return a + b;) by clicking in the gutter next to the line number.
                  Configure a launch.json for Node.js by selecting Node.js environment in the Debug view.
                  Start debugging (F5), and VS Code will pause execution at the breakpoint.
                  Use debugging controls (Step Over, Step Into, etc.) to navigate through the code and inspect variable values.
